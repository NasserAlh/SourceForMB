The line `volumeProfile.merge(priceInTicks, size, Integer::sum);` is a compact and powerful instruction that updates a map with new trade information. Let’s dissect it step-by-step:

1. **Target Map - `volumeProfile`**:
    - This is the map where the volume profile data is stored. Each entry in the map represents a price level and the corresponding traded volume at that price.

2. **Method - `merge`**:
    - The `merge` method is a part of Java’s Map interface, used for combining a new value with an existing value in the map.

3. **Key - `priceInTicks`**:
    - This represents the price of the trade, adjusted to a discrete tick value. It acts as the identifier for a particular price level in the `volumeProfile` map.

4. **New Value - `size`**:
    - This is the volume of the new trade that occurred. It's the value that will be merged with any existing value at the given key (`priceInTicks`).

5. **Merging Function - `Integer::sum`**:
    - This is a method reference to the `Integer.sum` method, which calculates the sum of two integer values. The `merge` method will use this function to combine the existing value with the new value (`size`) if the key (`priceInTicks`) already exists in the map.

Here’s how the `merge` method operates in this context:

- **Scenario 1 - Key Exists**:
    - If the key (`priceInTicks`) already exists in the `volumeProfile` map, the `merge` method will apply the merging function (`Integer::sum`) to the existing value and the new value (`size`). In simple terms, it adds the new trade volume to the existing volume at that price level.

- **Scenario 2 - Key Doesn’t Exist**:
    - If the key (`priceInTicks`) does not exist in the `volumeProfile` map, the `merge` method will simply create a new entry with `priceInTicks` as the key and `size` as the value.

The beauty of this line is its atomicity and thread-safety. In a multi-threaded environment, like a trading application, multiple threads might attempt to update the `volumeProfile` map simultaneously. The `merge` method, when used with a `ConcurrentSkipListMap`, ensures that these updates happen in a thread-safe manner, preventing data corruption and ensuring accurate tracking of the volume profile.

In summary, this single line of code elegantly handles the updating of a volume profile in a concurrent setting, by either adding new trade volume to an existing price level or introducing a new price level to the profile with the traded volume. This efficient handling is crucial for real-time updating of order-flow data which is paramount in the fast-paced world of intraday trading.
